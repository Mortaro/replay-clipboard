# VSCode Replay Clipboard

Pretend that you type like a **pr0h4x0r** in your videos by replaying whatever you have in your clipboard.

Download the extension from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChristianMortaro.vscode-replay-clipboard)

You can customize the random range in which each key is pressed as well as the chance of having a typo.

In case of a typo it will insert a key that is near the intended one in an ABNT keyboard then backspace and correct it.

Copy any code snippet to your clipboard (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>);

Place the cursor where you want it to type;

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> and get a million views with no effort!!!
